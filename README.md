# Improved Error Handling in Dart's Asynchronous Operations

This repository showcases a common error in Dart's asynchronous operations and provides an improved solution.

The original code (`bug.dart`) demonstrates a basic `try-catch` block for handling errors during a network request. However, it only prints the error to the console, which is insufficient for robust error handling in a production environment.

The improved solution (`bugSolution.dart`) demonstrates more robust error handling by:

1. Providing more specific error messages.
2. Handling different types of exceptions separately.
3. Returning a more informative result to the caller.
4. Using custom exceptions for better error categorization.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in asynchronous operations to create reliable and user-friendly applications.
